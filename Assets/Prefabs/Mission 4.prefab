  spellInvEnd: "Your spell worked like a charm! Last evening, I snuck into the young
    lords chambers and caught him fussing over a diary entry. Apparently he is deeply
    in love with someone! Though I\u2019m loathe to admit, I failed to find out who.
    Perhaps if I can figure out who it is and put in a good word for him I can yet
    prove myself a good friend."
  spellCurseEnd: "We\u2019ve received a letter from house Corrim. The young man who
    came to us for help wishes to inform you that his investigation of the lord from
    house Atredes was an utter train wreck. Ink was spilled all over some rather
    important documents, and apparently the young lord twisted his ankle. What a
    pity."
  spellProtEnd: "We\u2019ve received a letter from house Corrim. The young man who
    came to us for help wishes to inform you that his investigation of the lord from
    house Atredes was an utter train wreck. Ink was spilled all over some rather
    important documents, and apparently the young lord twisted his ankle. What a
    pity."
  spellSummEnd: A letter from house Corrim. Apparently the young man from house Atredes
    was quite impressed by our clients skill in magic, but was otherwise quite miffed
    to spend the day together rounding up and exercising the horde of summoned imps
    that results from our spell.
