    house is dying! Please, what can you do to help us? You are our last hope! Our
    line must continue!'

  potPoisonEnd: What a shame! What a horrible harbinger of the end of an era! The
    head of House Holister has died of the awful plague sweeping the city!
  potCharismaEnd: "House Holister has been quite successful in advocating for better
    sanitation during this trying time. Though they\u2019ve suffered their share
    of loss as well, it\u2019s gone far in lessening the effect of the plague. It
    seems the other house\u2019s opinion of them is much improved."
  potAntidoteEnd: One of the few houses to survive the plague that is sweeping the
    city thus far untouched seems to be house Holister. Certainly the other houses
    will have questions to ask of them.
  potTruthEnd: "Regarding house Holister; it seems nothing much has changed for better
    or for worse. Some, though not all of the noble house suffers under the burden
    of plague. I doubt we\u2019ll be hearing from the Duke for some time."
