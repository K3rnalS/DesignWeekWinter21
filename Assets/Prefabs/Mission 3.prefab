    during a grand ball last evening. Seems a jealous young lord from house Atredes
    slipped poison into his rival\u2019s drink. What a scandal. He\u2019s been arrested,
    of course. The contact of ours that he dealt with has been reassigned far far
    away, as per your request."

    in a grand ball last week. It seems everyone was quite endeared to a young noble

    soon.
  potAntidoteEnd: News from the nobles, and courtly intrigue. The young lord from
    house Atredes sends his regards. His rival was awkward and foibling all night.

    in a grand ball last week. It seems everyone was quite endeared to a young noble
