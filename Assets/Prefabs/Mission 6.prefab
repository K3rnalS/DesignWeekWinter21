  spellInvEnd: The information we and the minister received from the papers taken
    from house Corrim will prove to be sufficiently potent black mail material.
  spellCurseEnd: "The Minister from house Ellander was caught transcribing the private
    letters of house Corrim. I don\u2019t expect she\u2019ll be invited back around
    for tea any time soon."
  spellProtEnd: "\u2013 Seems that the minister from Ellander was caught sneaking
    out of the offices of house Corrim. She managed to convince them she was merely
    admiring the manor, but it\u2019s unlikely she\u2019ll be invited back to house
    Corrim any time soon."
  spellSummEnd: "Scandal! A minister from house Ellander set loose a pair of gelatinous
    cubes in the bathroom of house Corrim\u2019s manor. Certainly not a good look
    for house Ellander."
