  questName: A Situation in the Mines
  NPCIntro: A Minister from Atredes is looking for a way to increase the effectiveness
    of his mine workers. He claims that they've become superstitious lately, and
    refuse to work in the new vein of the mine. He wants to look into it himself.
    Perhaps we can offer him a spell to help his investigation?
  simpText: House Atredes want's to investigate their mine workers.

  spellInvEnd: It seems that the minister sent his guards into the mines for reconnaissance.
    The miners have been complaining about strange whispering in the new tunnels.
    We'll keep you updated if anything new surfaces.
  spellCurseEnd: It seems the miners have stop complaining about the new branch of
    tunnels. Our agents have reported that the minister has been seeing shadowy figures
    in the halls of his manor at night.
  spellProtEnd: It seems that the situation has calmed down. The miners seem amenable
    to working in the tunnels again.
  spellSummEnd: "There\u2019s been a collapse in the mine! Everyone is talking about
    it. Seems no one knows that cause just yet. None of the miners that were on duty
    at the time are willing to talk about it."
