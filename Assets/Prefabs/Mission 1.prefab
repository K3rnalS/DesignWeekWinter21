  potPoisonEnd: The Duke is dead. Long live the Duchess.
  potCharismaEnd: It seems duchess Conwyn's daughter is set to be married next month.
    It took some convincing, but apparently the duchess is on board with union, and
    quite grateful that her procured poison seemed to be ineffective on her darling
    husband.
  potAntidoteEnd: News from your network came in earlier today. It seems that there
    was a scuffle in a local dukedom. Apparently, in a desperate rage, the Duchess
    attacked the Duke, and has been rounded up by the guards for attempted murder.
  potTruthEnd: There's been a murder in a local dukedom. Apparently the Duke flew
    off in a rage and murdered his innocent wife after confessing to many a back
    ally murder. His daughter came forth and told the guards about his upcoming plans
    to murder another high ranking advisor to the king. Seems like he's been rounded
    up and put behind bars. His daughter has inherited control of her parents land.
